                <h2 class="person-name">Nathan Walker</h2>
                <h3 class="person-title">Owner / Publicist (Detroit, MI)</h3>
                <p class="person-bio">Raised in the woods of Northern Ontario and Michigan in the late '70s, early '80s, the music was always on. When family got together, there'd be whiskey and when there was whiskey, there was, inevitably, a guitar and "Rye Whiskey" performed with such fervor that it made Nick Cave's version sound like a children's song. It wasn't until the arrival of Nirvana-yes, that SNL performance to be exact-that he realized the real power of music's ability to save your life.</p>
                <p class="person-bio">In his 20's, his love of music led him to try on the various hats of concert photographer, door man, venue bartender, music writer, music editor, and, eventually, publicist. Specifically, he got a gig working with Frank Nieto and Lisa Gottheil at 2:30 Publicity. It was a wonderful introduction to working as a publicist but marriage, a move to the San Juan Islands and an absurd urge to open a cafe / music venue in the country pulled him into another path for a few years. The gravitational pull of the music industry proved to be too strong and, in 2009, he joined Riot Act Media working under the talented wizard known as Joan Hiller (now LeMay!) and became a partner at the company in 2012.</p>
                <p class="person-bio">As of December 1st, 2015, Joan left the company to pursue other dreams and handed Nathan the reigns at Riot Act Media. He currently lives in Detroit with his wife Kat, his cat Yoko, and their beautiful daughter! He overuses the word stoked but would, unabashedly, admit that's he's stoked on what the future holds.</p>

                <h2 class="person-name">Alyssa DeHayes</h2>
                <h3 class="person-title">Publicist (Athens, GA)</h3>
                <p class="person-bio">Alyssa DeHayes is a national publicist and media relations specialist for record labels, festivals and independent artists at Riot Act. Additionally, she loves demystifying PR and marketing strategies in one-on-one consulting sessions for artists and labels who aren’t quite ready for a full publicity campaign. She spends her lunch hour twice a week teaching music publicity and promotion at The University of Georgia’s Music Business Program, and volunteers for Girls Rock Athens.</p>
                <p class="person-bio">After graduating from journalism school at UGA with a public relations emphasis, she made Athens, GA her home base between work trips. Over the years she has collaborated on and lead successful campaigns for artists like Natalie Prass, Elf Power, His Name Is Alive, Olivia Tremor Control, Pill, Tonstartssbandht, and Balmorhea, for labels like Columbia, Mexican Summer, Run For Cover, Numero Group, Western Vinyl, New West, the Elephant-6 affiliated Orange Twin, Easy Sound Recording Co., Spacebomb, and Team Love. She has provided publicity, media relations, and/or on-site social media support for festivals like Hopscotch Music Festival, Governors’ Ball, Shaky Knees Fest, and Wildwood Revival.</p>
                <p class="person-bio">Her experience in this field informed a public relations column for the artist resource company Sonicbids. In 2013, she founded Arrowhawk Records (Arbor Labor Union, now on Sub-Pop, Cinemechanica, BAMBARA, Softspot, and more). Her love of puns spawned websites like the Parks & Rec-inspired Tom Haverfoods or the True Detective-themed Music Industry Rust Cohle, which received kudos from Time Magazine, Entertainment Weekly, and more.</p>
