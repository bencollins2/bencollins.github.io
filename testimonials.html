                <p>I cannot say enough good things about Nathan. Not only is he a stand-up guy, but he's an excellent
                    publicist. In 2015, we worked on two somewhat untraditional releases. One was an EP, and one was a
                    record that had been self-released nearly two years earlier. I knew Nathan was a great publicist,
                    and the music was amazing, but I also knew getting good editorial coverage on these records would be
                    difficult. I can honestly say that Nathan completely crushed both releases. Not only did he exceed
                    my high, but realistic expectations, he completely blew past them. I cannot say enough good things
                    about the work Nathan does. He is certainly on my very short list of publicists I call first.<br>

                <p>Nathan Walker is an ideal partner in the constantly changing and tumultuous world of independent
                    music. As a label looking for public relations assistance you can end up with folks who are simply
                    going to blast writers and not put in a title-specific effort versus someone who is really going to
                    understand both the label and the album(s) in question and going to really have honest conversations
                    with the members of the press who makes the most sense for that title. That difference, really and
                    truly digging into the music in question, sets Nathan apart from his peers. He is straight up,
                    transparent, and a great communicator. If you are looking to work with PR for the first time or make
                    the switch from somewhere else, give him a call as I think you'll be pleased.<br>

                <p>I can't recommend Nathan and Riot Act enough – we've worked together in various forms for a couple of
                    years on a whole bunch of releases and it's always been a pleasure. Showing both an extreme
                    understanding of his work and the current climate for press coverage, as well as a massive love for
                    music and those who create it, working with Nathan is both inspiring and rewarding – not to mention
                    that he's excellent at his job.<br>

                <p>Joan and Nathan have the unabashed enthusiasm that can only come from truly loving what they do.
                    They've been at it long enough now that they ought to be as jaded and cynical as the journalists
                    they interact with, but they never are. It's a passion that's infectious, like a wonderful disease,
                    but not infectious like that one Pink song that goes ‘nah nah nah nah nah nah, we're gonna start a
                    fight!<br>

                <div>You need three things to make it in the music business &gt; good looks, good drugs, and a good
                    publicist. You're on your own for the first two, but as far as publicity is concerned look no
                    further than Nathan Walker.<br>

                <p>Balmorhea has worked with Alyssa DeHayes since 2008, and each release and tour seems to only be upped
                    by the next. The only thing rivaling her passionate and professional pursuit of the best and highest
                    for her work is her sweet and personal disposition. It's a rare thing in this age for someone to
                    fully possess even one of these traits, let alone two. She is someone that bridges the gap between
                    client and friend; one who sends you care packages on tour and is wholly earnest about her pursuit
                    of your musical and personal well-being. The music world (and the world in general) needs more like
                    Alyssa.<br>

                <p>The press campaign for our record was already in progress when Nathan Walker took over. The previous
                    firm goofed up pretty bad, leaving Nathan with an even more difficult job than usual in soliciting
                    press. Despite the uphill battle, Nathan did a terrific job and surpassed our expectations. Riot Act
                    may be a small company, but I found them fiercely loyal, very attentive, and super devoted; a beacon
                    of Real in a biz increasingly fulla fakes and incompetents.<br>

                <p>We've worked with numerous publicists over the years, but Riot Act Media has been one of the most
                    efficient companies we've been lucky to work with.They're real fans of music, and it shows. We're
                    still amazed by Nathan's talents, and by all the coverage he got us for our Beachwood Sparks
                    release.<br>

                <p>When I finished my record, I was content with the idea that it would sit buried for eternity,
                    streaming anonymously to no one in some forgotten corner of the internet. It was a good record,
                    maybe even the best one I'd ever worked on, but I'd been around the track enough times to know that
                    "good" and "paid attention to" are hardly mutually exclusive. Nathan was beyond excited about my
                    sounds and energetic to the point of converting people to my weird little record. More new listeners
                    discovered my music in the last year than makes any natural sense, and it's due in large part to the
                    enthusiasm and palpable sense of belief put forth by Nathan and his cohort at Riot Act.<br>

                    with him…because he truly understands what we're doing and loves the music like we do. And because
                    of this, Nathan works his butt off to turn other folks on to it. There's a realness to the work he
                    does and I'm certain that shines through to the people in press who he is constantly reaching out
                    to. Nathan and the Riot Act team are great at what they do and they are also fantastic people. And
                    that means a whole lot in this industry.<br>

                <p>Nathan is lovely and only works with acts that he is a fan of so you have integrity there. He's also
                    great cheerleader of labels and acts which is helpful when you're in a high stress album campaign.
                    He'll go that extra mile to help a release achieve as much press as it can get-all round TOP

                <p>Nathan Walker and Riot Act are a PR firm that understands all the tricky facets of representing bands
                    and fulfilling their publicity needs.&nbsp; One has to be a skilled diplomat to be a good publicist
                    and Nathan certainly has that quality.&nbsp; He deals with the wishy-washy people on either side of
                    him (bands, journalists,editors,etc) in a way that puts everyone at ease and gets the job done and
                    leaves all involved with positive vibes about this funny game of publicity in the music
                    business.&nbsp; Some music biz services can't be quantified and fall under the category of "this is
                    something we need to do, but i don't know why" but using Riot Act and Nathan IS quantifiable-you
                    will see results AND you'll want to hire him again and again….so just do it, you'll be glad you
                    did.<br>

                    and fans best interests in mind but go for the easiest common denominator because it'll get whoever
                    mad clicks and traffic and stuff.<br>

                <p>Beyond their attentiveness to clients, thoughtful campaigns, and overall success as publicists, they
                    are genuine, honest, and passionate music fans. It's this boiling passion for music and what they do
                    at Riot Act that truly bodes well for the artists I work with and myself on a day-to-day basis.
                    Their enthusiasm and fervor shine through on all fronts and seemingly has helped to close the ever
                    pervasive gap between editors, bloggers, tastemakers, etc. and the artists they work with. I do and
                    will continue to recommend Riot Act Media to anyone I cross looking for help on the publicity
                    front.<br>

                <p>Nathan became a key member of the team for our release of Dana Falconberry's record, going well
                    beyond the call of duty to curate the initial publicity rollout and see it through into a slow-burn
                    that's bolstered the band's reputation for months of touring. It's been almost a year since the
                    release, and the album is still getting national coverage from the likes of NPR and New York Times.

                <p>I know on paper, Nathan Walker and I have a "pitch music, consider music, give feedback on music"
                    relationship, but really, I often feel like he's my personal shopping assistant, helping me choose
                    quality tunes to "try on," if you will. Sometimes navigating the musical blogosphere's waters is
                    tough going, sometimes I question what good music sounds like any more. But whenever I receive an
                    email from Nathan and the Riot Act Media team, I know I'm in caring hands—people who care not only
                    about the music they promote, but the people they promote it to. Riot Act Media is my co-pilot.<br>

                <p>Nathan, and Riot Act Media, went so far beyond the call of duty promoting my film, MAKE, that it
                    still continues to blow my mind. Although this was their first time out promoting a movie, they
                    brought in press from so many amazing outlets that never would have heard of my small film
                    otherwise; including Paper Magazine, SPIN, The Huffington Post, and the Utne Reader just to name a
                    few. I will definitely be returning to Riot Act Media in the future in order to have them shepherd
                    my new projects out into the world. Honestly, it was an incredible (and extremely productive)
